# Using positioning in Unity

The positioning for a Unity client consists of 3 components:

* A position client component receiving updates from the server
* A position listener component which subscribes to position updates from the position client and translates the entity to which it is attached
* An orientation component which rotates the entity to which it is attached based on the gyroscope
